MSIM 580 Assignment Two: Genetic Algorithm Triangle Image

The solution to the genetic algorithm problem consists of three java files located in
<this folder>/triangles
File 1: Draw.java
File 2: Triangle.java
File 3: GeneratedImage.java

These files can be compiled using the following command line command from <this folder>/triangles
javac Draw.java Triangle.java GeneratedImage.java
The GameInputOutput file contains the main method and can be executed with the following command from <this folder>
java triangles.Draw

In order to compile Java Development Kit (JDK) is required. The latest Standard Edition JDK can be downloaded here:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html
The path to the JAVA bin file may also need to be set using the following command line command from <this folder>/triangles
set path=C:\Program Files\Java\<jdk version>\bin

The user will be prompted for the following information: 
The name of an input file
The number of triangles to use to generate the image
The number of final output images to generate
The amount of time to run the Genetic Algorithm

Alternatively the folder containing this file can be imported into an IDE and executed through the IDE
This program was written using the Eclipse IDE

The folder containing this file aslo contains the input files used for this assignement and a results folder containing the output files resulting from generating each of the four images for three hours and performance data for each of the images
